#My project task is on DATA PIPELINE CREATION USING IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.I used Google collab platform to implementent the task.I took libraries like Pandas,Scikit learn and various libraries by importing it and using it. Where i used Pandas  for data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation in the ETL pipeline.
